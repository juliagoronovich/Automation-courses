Homework Part 2. As with the cat, you can implement the principles of OOP.

1. Abstraction
The goal of my project is to participate in a cat show.
I highlight the main characteristics of the animal:
the cat must meet all the characteristics of the breed externally, which is called not to be defective. Show class animal
the cat must be outwardly neat and tidy.
the cat must have a suitable calm character.
the cat must be healthy.
age from a year to 5 years (conditionally).
Further, I exclude secondary characteristics:
gender is not important, maybe both a cat and a cat.
exclude animals not show class and sick.
take into account the age limit, character.

2. Encapsulation.
I comb the hair before the show, thereby masking places where it is not of the same length. Weakness. I fix the hair in this form, I do not allow the animal to lick.
I do not feed the cat on the eve of the show with heavy food, in order to avoid falling asleep and problems with the digestive tract.
Not annoying, a playful mood can interfere with participation. 


3. Inheritance.
Choosing thoroughbred parents for a kitten, which Iâ€™m going to put on the show, I take into account the characteristics of the color, learning ability, health status. In order to avoid defects and defects.

4. Polymorphism.
Using the example of the method to move. I know that the Cat class involves fingering and tail movement to coordinate movements.
